To create this website, a program called brackets was used, though any text editor alone would work just as well.

Recommendations and improvements:
1. A spacer bar between each entry
2. A working sign up and log-in system
3. Potentially memberships to keep a source of income for the site

This project was another good learning experience. It gave a better understanding of the code below the surface of a webpage. Like most of the other projects, the processes of bug fixing and applying the coding lessons to something tangable really provided a good all around learning experience.
