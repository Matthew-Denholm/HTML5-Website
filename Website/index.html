            <h2>Your Project, Community Assisted</h2>
            <p>Like most people, you have hobbies and you have dreams, but your working life doesn't allow you the time to complete them. Or you have hit a downfall of creativity and need some inspiration. Whatever the project is, this is the hub to get it noticed, and to get it done.</p>
            <h2>Your Project is Your Idea</h2>
            <p>It feels awful to work so pationately for something and find out someone stole it. Our database keeps track of when a project originates and the person who created it, so others can't steal it for their own good.</p>
            <h2>The Community Is Yours</h2>
            <p>Public, Invite only, or Private? You have full control over who works on what with this project. Divide the project into tasks with managable goals, leave it as a general statement for you alone to work on.</p>
            <h2>What are You Waiting For?</h2>
            <p>Visit the projects page to see if there's a project for you. If not, why not make one yourself?</p>
